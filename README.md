# Task - Tracker

A new Flutter application which I created as the part of learning flutter and Dart.
This is a simple application where user can add new entries, delete new entries and they can mark each item as done using the chechboxes and more.
The main purpose of creating this app is to learn statemanagement concepts in flutter. And I implemented the concepts of 'Lifting the state up' and Providers for handling the state and data.
